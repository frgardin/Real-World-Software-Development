# Real-World Software Development - Study Project

This project is based on the book **"Desenvolvimento Real de Software"**, which aims to teach the principles of SOLID design using the Java programming language. The repository contains exercises, examples, and implementations inspired by the book to deepen understanding of software design best practices.

## Objectives

- Learn and apply the SOLID principles.
- Improve software design skills using Java.
- Explore real-world scenarios and solutions presented in the book.

## Topics Covered

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-world-software-development.git
    ```
2. Navigate through the examples and exercises for each SOLID principle.
3. Run and modify the code to experiment and reinforce learning.
